# Express with React practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's main idea is to process static JSON files on express server, which are then used to be served on the client with React. The use should be able to view and edit the information.

## To run the project:

In the project directory install the dependencies by running

### Run `yarn install`

### Run `yarn dev`

This will start the Express server on `localhost:5000`\
and will run the React app on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To run the tests:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
